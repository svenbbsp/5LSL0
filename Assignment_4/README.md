## Overview
This is an assignment for the course 5LSL0 Machine learning for signal processing 2023-2024

## Contents
- `MNIST_dataloader.py`: This file contains the functions to load the MNIST dataset including the noisy images, clean images and labels.
- `Fast_MRI_dataloader`: This file contains the functions to load the MRI datasets
- `Assignment_4_Notebook.ipynb`: This notebook contains the code to run all the exercises
- `Fast_MRI_Knee/`: This directory contains the MRI training and testing images

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or above
- PyTorch 1.7 or above
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- tqdm
- Jupyter

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages listed in the 'Requirements' section.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook [`Assignment_4_Notebook.ipynb`](./Assignment_4_Notebook.ipynb) to execute the exercises.
4. The [`MNIST_dataloader.py`](./MNIST_dataloader.py) and [`Fast_MRI_dataloader.py`](./Fast_MRI_dataloader.py) scripts are used within the notebook to load the respective datasets.
5. The MRI images for training and testing are located in the [`Fast_MRI_Knee/`](./Fast_MRI_Knee/) directory.

## Results
The results of the exercises, including the reconstructed images and performance metrics, are presented and discussed in the Jupyter notebook and the final report.
